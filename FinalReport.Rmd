## Introduction/Background:

Our group wanted to take an in-depth look at American work-life balance. There are many facets to explore, such as how sex, job type, marital status, location, age, and number of dependents play a role in work-life balance, and how this has changed over time.

We collected our data from the IPUMS database, which has a collection of American Census data as well as American Community Surveys. The Census records span from 1790-2010, and the American Community Surveys span from 2000-present. The IPUMS database provides free access to social and economic data, and there is a massive collection of observations, with a wide array of variables.  





## Data Collection:
On IPUMS database, we selected a subset of variables and then selected a sample of 15,000 households per census/survey. We narrowed our scope to be from 1980-now, to get a better look at the most recent changes in work-life balance.
