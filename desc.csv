YEAR,Census year,"YEAR reports the four-digit year when the household was enumerated or included in the census, the ACS, and the PRCS.

For the multi-year ACS/PRCS samples, YEAR indicates the last year of data included (e.g., 2007 for the 2005-2007 3-year ACS/PRCS; 2008 for the 2006-2008 3-year ACS/PRCS; and so on).  For the actual year of survey in these multi-year data, see MULTYEAR.",NA,1,4,0,integer,NA
SERIAL,Household serial number,"SERIAL is an identifying number unique to each household record in a given sample. All person records are assigned the same serial number as the household record that they follow. (Person records also have their own unique identifiers - see PERNUM.) A combination of SAMPLE and SERIAL provides a unique identifier for every household in the IPUMS; the combination of SAMPLE, SERIAL, and PERNUM uniquely identifies every person in the database.

For 1850-1930, households that are part of a multi-household dwelling can be identified by using the DWELLING and DWSEQ variables. See ""Sample Designs"" for further discussion of sampling from within multi-household dwellings.","CodesSERIAL is an 8-digit numeric variable which assigns a unique identification number to each household record in a given sample (See PERNUM for the analogous person record identifier).

HHWT,Household weight,"HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the ""flat"" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.

Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see ""Sample Designs"" and ""Sample Weights"". See also PERWT for a corresponding variable at the person level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 1% and 1950.","CodesHHWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals.

User Note: The traditional unit of land area in Puerto Rico is the cuerda. The cuerda is equal to about 3930 square meters, 4700 square yards, or 0.971 acres. Because the cuerda and the acre are so close to being equal, they are often treated informally as being equal. Mainlanders sometimes call the unit the ""Spanish Acre.""
